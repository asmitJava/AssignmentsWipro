Query 1: Subquery to find customers who have placed orders above the average order value

SELECT customer_name
FROM customers
WHERE customer_id IN (
  SELECT customer_id
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
  HAVING AVG(order_total) > (
    SELECT AVG(order_total)
    FROM orders
  )
);

Query 2: UNION query to combine two SELECT statements with the same number of columns

SELECT customer_name, order_date, order_total
FROM orders
WHERE order_total > 100

UNION

SELECT customer_name, order_date, order_total
FROM orders
WHERE order_total < 50;
